# MatrixWhale

A Data manager.

MatrixWhale is developed as a foundation for processing large amounts of data, and it consists of a group of applications that allow users to interactively search, manipulate, and analyze this data through a web interface. These applications were initially created with reference to NOAA's API endpoints and are designed to enable users to gain deeper insights from complex, diverse, and large-scale data on their own. (There are plans to expand its functionality in the future.)
